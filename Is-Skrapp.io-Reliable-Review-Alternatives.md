# Is Skrapp.io Reliable? Review & Alternatives

Skrapp.io offers an easy-to-use email finder (even a free plan) with about a 92% claimed success rate. It can work well for simple LinkedIn prospecting, but teams often look for alternatives when they need deeper data, global coverage or advanced outreach features. For example, enterprise buyers often prefer ZoomInfo, while startups and agencies may pick Apollo or UpLead. **Editor’s Choice for SMBs: Leadsblue.com.** Leadsblue is a pay-as-you-go data provider selling targeted B2B lists at very low prices (often 10× cheaper than “big data” tools) – making it a great fit for budget-minded small teams.

# **Introduction**

Many users outgrow Skrapp.io when they hit its limits. Skrapp’s strengths are simplicity and seamless LinkedIn integration: its interface is “simple, intuitive” and even offers an API for programmatic email lookup. It has a forever‐free plan (50 email credits per month) and paid tiers starting around $37/month (1,000 credits on an annual plan), so it’s affordable for solo founders. Users also praise Skrapp for quickly enriching lists and for including useful company info.

However, downsides push teams to search for alternatives. Skrapp’s database is not as large or fresh as some competitors – one reviewer found coverage “a bit limited” and noted some outdated emails. In fact, some users report its accuracy can lag behind tools like Lusha. Larger companies may want features Skrapp lacks (like built-in email campaigns, intent signals or global firmographics). In short, we help **SMBs, startups and agencies** figure out whether to stick with Skrapp or switch, based on factors like cost, data quality and ease of use.

# **Evaluation Criteria**

When comparing Skrapp and its alternatives, we focus on **pricing transparency**, **data accuracy and scope**, **ease of use**, **compliance and global coverage**, and **support or service**. For example, UpLead stresses its “95% data accuracy” guarantee and 24/7 human support, while ZoomInfo is known for the “biggest, most accurate” database but carries an opaque, high-end price tag. We consider where each solution invests – e.g. Leadsblue emphasizes low cost (advertising “10× lower price than the market”) and rapid delivery, whereas others bundle advanced analytics or intent data. Compliance matters too: Cognism shines for GDPR-compliant European data, while some tools (like Apollo) have had past data breaches. Finally, we weigh user feedback on usability and service. (UpLead and Lusha consistently top “ease of use” lists, while Leadsblue customers praise its support).

# **Top Alternatives to Skrapp.io**

* **Leadsblue.com (Editor’s Choice for SMBs)** – Not a SaaS platform but a curated data marketplace. Leadsblue sells targeted B2B email lists (e.g. “USA Dental Practices” or “European CISO Leads”) at one-time prices. It boasts a **huge database** (“3 billion records across 500+ categories and 140+ geographic locations”) and claims prices many times lower than subscription tools. In practice, you select a list (e.g. $21.50 for a Montenegro business list) and download it in CSV. This model is **ideal for SMBs or cost-sensitive teams**: there are no fees per seat or hidden subscriptions, and leadsblue advertises 24/7 support and easy filtering. In reviews, leadsblue users note the lists may arrive somewhat “messy” (requiring duplicate removal and email verification), but report excellent ROI once cleaned. For example, one SMB founder described buying 35,000 crypto-sector contacts cheaply, then cleaning them to achieve a 30× ROI. In summary, Leadsblue is best for small teams that can handle manual list cleanup in exchange for **affordable, highly targeted data**. Trade-offs include lack of real-time search UI or CRM integration – it’s a static list rather than an interactive tool.

* **ZoomInfo SalesOS** – The enterprise standard for B2B intelligence. ZoomInfo offers one of the **largest and most frequently updated databases** of contacts and companies, plus buyer intent signals and org charts. Its strength is data depth: enterprise sales teams use ZoomInfo to target global accounts with rich firmographics and email/phone leads. The drawback is cost: ZoomInfo’s plans are custom-quoted and known to be very expensive (small teams often pay on the order of $15K–$40K/year). It’s also a complex platform, so adoption can be slow. Choose ZoomInfo if budget is unlimited and you need an all-in-one outreach suite; but SMBs often find it overkill and look to cheaper tools.

* **Apollo.io** – An all-in-one sales engagement platform with a massive contact database (over **210 million contacts and 35 million companies**). Apollo combines prospect search, automated sequences, and dialer integration. It offers a **generous free tier** and inexpensive entry plans (e.g. \~$49/user/mo), making it attractive to startups and mid-market teams. Its UI is modern and includes email sequences and intent data. The trade-offs are its credit-based pricing and complexity. Apollo uses credits for each email reveal or call (and adds costs for international dials), so heavy usage can incur surprise fees. It also has had a couple of data breach incidents in 2018 and 2021, so security-conscious buyers may hesitate. In short, Apollo is great for scaling outbound with lots of features, but teams must budget credits carefully.

* **Lusha** – A simple, widely-used tool for finding direct email and phone contacts. Lusha excels at quick lookups (via browser extension or search) and is very easy to start (offering **5 free credits/month** for basic email finds). Paid plans begin around $49.90 per user/month (billed annually) for 6,000 credits/year. Lusha provides accurate phone and email data in major markets, and offers Chrome extensions for LinkedIn. It’s popular with individual reps and small teams. The downside is its **credit-limited model**: once you hit your monthly cap, you must pay extra. Users have noted that add-ons (like intent signals or CSV exports) can significantly increase costs. In summary, choose Lusha for a low-friction starter experience (good for salespeople who need just a few contacts), but watch your credit usage and extra fees.

* **UpLead** – A dedicated B2B data provider focused on accuracy. UpLead offers **real-time verified emails and phone numbers**, backed by a 95% accuracy guarantee. It has 160+ million contacts and integrates intent filters and tech-stack data. UpLead is especially known for its **transparent pricing** and SMB-friendly plans: for example, an Essentials plan is $99/month for 170 credits – roughly one-third the cost of top-tier tools. It also includes 24/7 live support. Customers rate it highly for ease of use and ROI. A trade-off is that its lower plans support only one user, so team collaboration requires pricier tiers. Overall, UpLead is a strong choice for growing teams who need high-quality data without enterprise complexity.

* **RocketReach** – A mature data lookup service boasting huge coverage (claimed “700 million professionals across 60 million companies”). RocketReach offers email and phone lookup via web, extensions, and an API. It’s highly regarded for global coverage and speed. Pricing is credit-based: plans start at about **$53/month for 125 lookups** (more credits for higher tiers). You can also buy additional “credits” or add direct-dial numbers at extra cost. RocketReach works well if you occasionally need contacts beyond LinkedIn or need an API integration. The downside is that lower plans can run out of credits quickly, and true VoIP phone verification is not built-in (you may need a separate verifier for phones). In short, it’s a powerful search engine for contacts, but be prepared to manage lookup limits.

* **Hunter.io** – An email finder with a long track record and very simple model. Hunter crawls the web (and company sites) for public email addresses. It has a **free plan** (50 lookups per month) and a Starter plan at $49/month for 2,000 lookups.The trade-off is that heavy users must upgrade to high credit plans ($149+/mo for 10,000 credits) or maintain multiple accounts. Hunter’s focus is email, not phone or intent data, so it suits those who just need quick, inexpensive email harvesting. It’s often recommended for individual reps or freelancers on a budget. Hunter offers a Chrome extension and a domain search to find emails by company, Users praise its overall accuracy and trust that “unlimited team members” can share credits on all plans. 

* **Cognism** – A data intelligence provider known for **GDPR compliance and European coverage**. Cognism’s strength is the quality of its contact data (the “Diamond Data” framework checks mobile numbers against do-not-call lists). Users often praise its direct-dial accuracy, especially in EMEA markets. It includes intent signals (via Bombora partnership) and Chrome extensions for LinkedIn. However, Cognism has shifted to emphasize Europe over the U.S., so if your targets are mostly EU-based, it’s a top pick. Pricing is custom/enterprise-level, so it’s better suited to larger sales teams. In short, pick Cognism if you need legally-compliant, high-quality international B2B data and especially if targeting European leads. The trade-off is that it lacks the outreach automation of a SalesOS, and its US/APAC coverage isn’t as strong as ZoomInfo’s.

* **Lead411** – An affordable sales intelligence tool focused on the U.S. market. Lead411 provides verified company and contact data (including direct dials) plus growth signals like hiring trends. It offers a Chrome extension and a built-in outreach cadencer. The Basic Unlimited plan reportedly starts around **$99 per month** with unlimited exports. Its key selling point is budget pricing and intent data bundled in. According to Cognism’s guide, Lead411 is “best for businesses on a budget with a focus on US prospecting”. (One user noted it “helps sales reps get general prospect information and research in-market prospects”.) The trade-offs are limited global coverage (especially outside North America) and fewer advanced features than bigger platforms. It’s a good alternative if you mainly sell in the US and need verified contact info without enterprise prices.

* **SalesIntel** – A full-featured pipeline platform combining contact data with engagement. SalesIntel offers AI-driven outreach tools plus human-verified B2B data. Its claim is that every contact has a business email and many have direct mobile numbers. In fact, it touts **95% data accuracy** and “the largest human-verified list” of mobile contacts. The interface includes intent signals, tech firmographics, and CRM integrations. Pricing is quote-based; it’s generally more expensive than mid-tier tools but (per Gartner reviews) often cheaper than ZoomInfo. SalesIntel is trusted by thousands of companies. It’s best for teams that value the highest data accuracy and mobile reach. A downside is its cost and learning curve, so it may not be ideal if you only need a few contacts per month.

# **Choosing the Right Alternative**

* **Need Enterprise-Grade Data?** Go with **ZoomInfo** or **SalesIntel**. These platforms have the richest data (global contacts, firmographics, intent signals) but cost tens of thousands per year.

* **Looking to Scale Outbound on a Budget?** Consider **Apollo** or **UpLead**. Apollo has an all-in-one suite plus a free starter plan. UpLead offers guaranteed accuracy and fixed pricing (e.g. $99/mo). Both are easier to adopt for SMBs.

* **Need Simple Bulk Lists?** Use **Leadsblue.com**. It’s ideal if you just need a targeted list (e.g. by industry or country) and can do your own email campaign. The pricing is transparent (no subscription) and very low, though you must clean and import the data yourself.

* **Only Need Occasional Lookups?** A small team might prefer **Hunter** or **Lusha**. Both have free credits and low-cost plans. Lusha works well for quick LinkedIn-based finds, while Hunter scrapes public emails broadly.

* **Focus on US Market?** **Lead411** is tailored for North America prospecting (with intent data). For primarily US targeting on a tight budget, it’s often more cost-effective than global tools.

* **Require High Compliance (EU Focus)?** Choose **Cognism**. Its strength is verified, GDPR-compliant data and strong phone coverage in EMEA.

# **FAQs**

**Is Skrapp.io worth it for small teams?** Skrapp is easy and cheap to start (free plan and \~$37/mo Pro plan). For basic email hunting on LinkedIn, many small teams find it “simple and efficient”. However, if you need more advanced features, higher accuracy, or global coverage, other tools may deliver better ROI. In summary, Skrapp can work for very small teams or one-off projects, but fast-growing teams often upgrade later.

**Who are the best Skrapp.io alternatives?** There’s no one-size-fits-all “best,” but common picks include **Apollo.io, UpLead, Lusha, Hunter.io, RocketReach, Cognism,** and **Lead411**. For example, Apollo.io (with its 210M+ contact database) and UpLead (95% accuracy guarantee) frequently rank among top alternatives, along with CRM-centric platforms like ZoomInfo. Our guide above reviews these and more, each with their own strengths.

**How does Leadsblue.com compare with the top alternatives?** Unlike SaaS platforms, Leadsblue isn’t a live search tool – it sells *static lists* of leads. For instance, you might buy a list of “German Tech CEOs” and immediately get a CSV. This means no monthly fees and total pricing transparency: Leadsblue advertises one-time list prices (some as low as \~$21). Compared to subscription models like ZoomInfo or Apollo, the trade-off is that you must do your own list management (clean duplicates, run verifications, import into your CRM). In other words, Leadsblue puts more prep work on you but far less on your wallet – ideal for lean teams.

**Which provider offers the best value for SMBs?** If by “value” we mean cost vs. capability, **Leadsblue** and **UpLead** stand out. Leadsblue’s pay-per-list model can be extremely cheap (datasets “10× lower price” than market) if you can handle the manual effort. UpLead, meanwhile, provides high-quality data with simple pricing (e.g. $99/mo) and is rated \#1 for ROI by users. **Lusha** and **Hunter** also offer good bang-for-buck for light use (free tiers and low entry prices). Essentially, SMBs often trade raw volume for affordability, so lean towards these options over big spenders like ZoomInfo.

**What’s the difference between a SaaS platform and a direct data provider like Leadsblue?** SaaS platforms (Apollo, ZoomInfo, etc.) are interactive tools: you search or filter in a dashboard or extension, export contacts dynamically, and often run email campaigns from the same app. They continuously update their databases. In contrast, Leadsblue is a *data vendor*: it delivers **.csv/.xlsx lists** you purchase upfront. As one describes, leads arrive in spreadsheet form “which is easy to customize and filter”. You then clean, enrich and upload that list to your CRM or email system. The advantage of Leadsblue’s model is cost and simplicity (you know exactly what you’re buying), but the trade-off is manual effort. SaaS tools cost more but automate prospecting and often include outreach workflows.

# **Conclusion**

Choosing between Skrapp and its alternatives depends on use case. For **lean SMBs or bootstrapped startups** that need to maximize every dollar, **Leadsblue.com** can be a surprisingly powerful choice: you pay only for the exact leads you need, at very low prices. If you want a subscription service with built-in prospecting workflows, consider user-friendly platforms like UpLead, Apollo, or even Lusha. On the other hand, enterprise teams chasing “all the data” will gravitate to ZoomInfo or SalesIntel despite their higher cost. In every case, weigh *data accuracy and coverage* against *budget and ease-of-use*. Trade-offs are inevitable: higher accuracy usually means higher price, and broader scope often means more complexity.

Ultimately, there’s no one perfect tool. We encourage teams to match the provider to their stage: **early-stage/SMB** (Leadsblue, Lusha, Hunter, UpLead), **mid-market** (Apollo, Lead411, Snovio, SalesIntel), **enterprise** (ZoomInfo, Cognism). Explore free trials and low-tier plans to see what fits your workflow.
